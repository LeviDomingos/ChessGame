# ChessGame

## Chess Game
This is a personal project and the objective of this project is to test my JavaScript knowledge. This project will hepl me to put to practice everything that I learnt so far.

My project is for current and potential student that are learnig to create games or want to improve their skills too. The website is very simple to use. Users will find easy to navegate the website and play.   

## **User Stories**

As a potential FrontEnd developer I want to feel confortable using JavaScript and expand my knowledge in one of the most popular language on the internet. As developer I want people to enjoy the games created by me.

I drew wireframes using Balsamiq. The pictures or art work shows how users will come across with on mobile, desktop and tablet.

There are some differences between my wireframes and my final website. This was due to visual preferences and feedback received from other users who tested my website.

## *Features*
1.  A very basic menu that allows to choose what pieve to play with

# Main Page

As soon as the page loads up the user will see:

- The board will be shown. 

- You need to select from the menu what "Piece" to play with.

## Features Left to Implement

Once I've learnt JavaScript, I will add further functionality to the existing features on my website, such as:

- The user will be able to register and login to the website, customise the page to their preferences
- The user will save the game and continue from where left
- The user will see a chart displaying all the best personal scores and others players too
- Pay with AI
- 
**HTML5**
The project uses HTML5 to create the basic elements and content of my website.

**CSS3**
The project uses CSS3 to add custom styles to the elements and content of my website.

**JavaScritp**
99% of the code has been written in pure JavaScript language only.

**JQuery**
1% of the code was written in jQuery.

**JavaScript**
The project uses JavaScript from Bootstrap which is required to add functionality to some of Bootstrap's components.

**Git**
I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Cloud9, before pushing them to GitHub.

**GitHub**
I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.
